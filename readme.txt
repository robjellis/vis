%
%    * Portions of the code call SPM functions (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), 
%      which is also released under the GNU General Public License.  SPM
%      must be installed and running for vis to work
%
%    * The MATLAB "statistics" toolbox must be installed for vis to function.

%    INSTALLATION:
%
%    1. Unzip vis.zip. In Linux, use this command: unzip <path>/vis.zip
%    2. Place the unzipped folder within the "toolbox" folder in your SPM directory.
%       This should result in vis being available upon rebooting of SPM.
%    3. To run the program, type "vis" at the MATLAB prompt. SPM must be active in the path,
%       but does not need to be actively running.
